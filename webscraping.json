WW16 531.12  ",
    "Cognitive state of the brain is an emergent property arising out of interactions among brain regions. Neuronal connections serve as conduits of communication forming the underlying architecture giving rise to brain functions. Structural controllability analysis is a promising method for investigating control mechanisms of brain network and for finding \u2018driver regions\u2019 that are central to its control. Neuronal connectivity has been investigated for various animal systems including C. elegans, drosophila, zebrafish, cat, and macaque. Within the limited data available, these studies have probed the structural organization and circuits in an attempt to infer their functional relevance. By investigating controllability of C. elegans neuronal network, the only complete connectome available till date, earlier studies have identified and characterized its driver neurons. Macaca mulatta is an extensively studied model organism having neuroanatomy very close to that of the human. Tract-tracing studies of macaque brain have been compiled in an accessible database called CoCoMac. We constructed the Macaque Brain Network (MBN) using data from CoCoMac that encodes directional connectivity of brain regions. MBN comprises of 6602 directed connections among 360 brain regions spanning the brain. This network was observed to have small-world nature with an exponential connectivity distribution. Using controllability analysis, we identified a total of 39 (24 distinct) \u2018driver regions\u2019 that are critical for achieving full control over the state of the network. Among them, the major brain regions are: Thalamus, Prefrontal Cortex, Motor cortex, Caudal SMA, Broca\u2019s area, Granular retrolimbic area, Dorsolateral visual cortex, Orbitofrontal cortex, Visual area 3A, Amygdala, Posterior parietal area, Prestriate cortex, and Ventral occipito temporal area. These regions, associated with vision, attention, memory, motor, speech, information relay, and sensory integration, emerged as critical for driving the brain network in any desired cognitive state.

    "\u00bb R. Tiwari, P. Jain, S. Butail, P.B. Sujit and M.A. Goodrich paper titled \"Effect of leader placement on robotic swarm control\", accepted for publishing at International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Sytems (AAMAS) to be held on 8th to 12th May in  Sao Paulo, Brazil. Human control of a robotic swarm entails selecting a few influential leaders who can steer the collective efficiently and robustly. However, a clear measure of influence with respect to leader position is not adequately studied. Studies with animal systems have shown that leaders who exert strong couplings  may be located in front, where they provide energy benefits, or in the middle, where they can be seen by a larger section of the group. In this paper, we systematically vary number of leaders and leader positions in simulated robotic swarms of two different sizes, and assess their effect on steering effectiveness and energy expenditure. In particular, we analyze the effect of placing leaders in the front, middle, and periphery, on the time to converge and lateral acceleration of a swarm of robotic agents as it performs a single  turn to reach the desired goal direction. Our results show that swarms with leaders in the middle and periphery take less time to converge than swarms with leaders in the front, while the lateral acceleration between the three placement strategies is not different. We also find that the time to converge towards the goal direction reduces with the increase in percentage of leaders in the swarm, although this value decays slowly beyond the percentage of leaders at 30%. As the swarm size is increased to twice the number of agents, we find that the leaders in the periphery become less effective in reducing the time to converge. Finally, closer analysis of leader placement and coverage reveals that front leaders within the swarm tend to expand their coverage and move towards the center as the maneuver is performed. Results from this study are expected to inform leader placement strategies towards more effective human swarm interaction systems.",

    "\u00bb Adaptive multi-voltage scaling in wireless NoC for high performance low power applications authored by Hemanta Kumar Mondal;Sri Harsha Gade;Raghav Kishore and Sujay Deb published in Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition (DATE), 2016. Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) have garnered significant interest as communication backbone for multicore processors used across a wide range of fields that demand higher computation capability. Wireless NoCs (WNoCs) by augmenting single hop, long range wireless links with wired interconnects; offer the most promising solution to reduce multi-hop long distance communication bottlenecks and opens up innumerable possibilities of topological innovations that are not possible otherwise. However, energy consumption in routers along with Wireless Interface (WI) components still remains considerably high. Specifically for large systems with many nodes in the network, a significant amount of energy is consumed by the communication infrastructure (routers, links, WIs). The usage of the routers and WIs are application dependent and for most cases performance requirements can be met without operating the whole communication infrastructure to its maximum limit. Dynamic reconfigurable systems that can switch between both high performance and low power modes can cater to wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose a novel design methodology for energy efficient WNoC using Adaptive Multi-voltage Scaling (AMS) that reduces dynamic power consumption, along with power gating to prevent static power dissipation in routers and WIs. We evaluate our proposed design in presence of real and synthetic traffic patterns. This approach saves up to 62.50% of static power with less than 1% area overhead. In different traffic scenarios, the proposed WNoC reduces overall packet energy dissipation up to 35% on average compared to a regular WNoC, without significant performance degradation. Design considerations for augmenting existing WNoCs with these routers and corresponding overheads are also presented.\n\tMore information can be obtained here: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7459513&c...",
    "\u00bb Dr. Pydi Ganga Bahubalindruni co-authored the paper titled \u201cInfluence of channel length scaling on InGaZnO TFTs characteristics: current-gain cutoff frequency, intrinsic voltage-gain and on-resistance\u201d which is accepted, IEEE/OSA Journal of display technology. This paper presents a study concerning the role of channel length scaling on IGZO TFT technology benchmark parameters, which are fabricated at temperatures not exceeding 180oC. The parameters under investigation are unity current gain cutoff frequency, intrinsic voltage-gain and on-resistance of the bottom-gate IGZO TFTs. As the channel length varies from 160 \u00b5m to 3 \u00b5m, the measured cutoff frequency increases from 163 kHz to 111.5 MHz, which is a superior value compared to the other competing low-temperature thin-film technologies, such as organic TFTs. On the other hand, for the same transistor dimensions, the measured intrinsic voltage-gain is changing from 165 to 5.3 and the on-resistance is decreasing from 1135.6 k\u2126 to 26.1 k\u2126. TFTs with smaller channel length (3 \u00b5m) have shown a highly negative turn-on voltage and hump in the sub-threshold region, which can be attributed to short channel effects. The results obtained here, together with their interpretation based on device physics, provide crucial information for accurate IC design, enabling an adequate selection of device dimensions to maximize the performance of different circuit building blocks assuring the multifunctionality demanded by system-on-panel concepts.

They are essential to increase the life time of a battery operated systems or in wearable technology. This paper presented a low-cost, very low-power linear analog adder with oxide TFTs, which was fabricated at low temperature (not exceeding 200 degrees). The fabricated circuit performance was tested under normal ambient.\n\tA novel linear analog adder is proposed only with n-type enhancement IGZO TFTs that computes summation of four voltage signals. However, this design can be easily extended to perform summation of more number of signals, just by adding a single TFT for each additional signal in the input block. The circuit needs few number of transistors, only a single power supply irrespective of the number of voltage signals to be added, and offers good accuracy over a reasonable range of input values. The circuit was fabricated on glass substrate with the annealing temperature not exceeding 200 degrees C. The circuit performance is characterized from measurements under normal ambient at room temperature, with a power supply voltage of 12V and a load of 4 pF. The designed circuit has shown a linearity error of 2.3% (until input signal peak to peak value is 2V), a power consumption of 78 uW and a bandwidth of 115 kHz, under the worst case condition (when it is adding four signals with the same frequency). In this , it has been noticed that the second harmonic is 32 dB below the fundamental frequency component. This circuit could offer an economic alternative to the conventional approaches.",

The original algorithm is not applicable to concave shapes since the weights are based on the Euclidean distance. A number of recent MLS-based deformation algorithms have proposed shape-aware extensions, but only for point handles. In contrast, we suggest a closed-form mathematical solution that applies naturally to point handles as well as line handles. In particular, our solution is based on the interior distance metric to the MLS weights for line handles so that they are shape aware and produce plausible deformations.",

    "\u00bb   Multi-Heuristic A* paper co-authored by Sandip Aine accepted for publication in International Journal of Robotics Research The performance of heuristic search-based planners depends heavily on the quality of the heuristic function used to focus the search. Consequently, the research in developing an efficient planner for a specific domain becomes the design of a good heuristic function. However, for many domains, it is hard to design a single heuristic function that captures all of the complexities of the problem. Furthermore, it is hard to ensure that heuristics are admissible (provide lower bounds on the cost-to-goal) and consistent, which is necessary for A* like searches to provide guarantees on completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. In this paper, we develop a novel heuristic search, called Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*), that takes in multiple, arbitrarily inadmissible heuristic functions in addition to a single consistent heuristic, and uses all of them simultaneously to search in a way that preserves guarantees on completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. This enables the search to combine very effectively the guiding powers of different heuristic functions and simplifies dramatically the process of designing heuristic functions by a user because these functions no longer need to be admissible or consistent. We support these claims with experimental analysis on several domains ranging from inherently continuous domains such as full-body manipulation and navigation to inherently discrete domains such as the sliding tile puzzle.",

    "Programs are susceptible to malformed data coming from untrusted sources. Occasionally the programming logic or constructs used are inappropriate to handle all types of constraints that are imposed by legal and well-formed data. As a result programs produce unexpected results or even worse, they may crash. Program behavior in both of these cases is highly undesirable. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid approach that saves programs from crashing when the failures originate from malformed strings or inappropriate handling of strings. Our approach statically analyses a program to identify statements that are vulnerable to failures related to associate string data. It then generates patches that are likely to satisfy constraints on the data, and in case of failures produce program behavior which would be close to the expected. The precision of the patches is improved with the help of a dynamic analysis. The patches are activated only after a failure is detected, and the technique incurs no runtime overhead during normal course of execution, and negligible overhead in case of failures. We have experimented with JAVA String API, and applied CLOTHO to several popular open-source libraries to patch 30 bugs, several of them rated either critical or major. Our evaluation shows that CLOTHO is both practical and effective. The comparison of the patches generated by our technique with the actual patches developed by the programmers in the later versions shows that they are semantically similar.",
